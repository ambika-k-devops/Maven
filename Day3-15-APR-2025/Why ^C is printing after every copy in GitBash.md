Ah, understood â€” when you're copying and pasting, if you accidentally press **Ctrl+C** (`^C`), it shows up on the terminal.
In Linux terminals, **`^C`** is the signal for "interrupt" (SIGINT), so it's expected behavior â€” but if you're just pasting and don't want **`^C`** to be printed or shown:

**Here are a few tips:**

---

âœ… **1. Don't press Ctrl+C manually while pasting.**

* **Ctrl+C** is *not* needed for copying or pasting into the terminal.
* Just **right-click paste** or **use Ctrl+Shift+V** in most terminal emulators.

(For copying from your local machine, yes, you can use Ctrl+C, but once you move your mouse to the terminal, don't press it again â€” just paste.)

---

âœ… **2. Use the mouse "paste" options.**

* If you're on a GUI (like PuTTY, MobaXterm, or a Linux terminal window), you can right-click and paste.
* Or use the menu: **Edit â†’ Paste**.

---

âœ… **3. If you're SSHed into a server and itâ€™s happening while copying multiple lines, try:**

* **Paste carefully line by line**, or
* **Use a paste-friendly tool** like `tmux` or `screen` â€” these prevent accidental signal sends.

---

âœ… **4. You can disable Ctrl+C temporarily (not recommended unless needed).**

* You could *trap* the Ctrl+C signal so that it doesnâ€™t kill your session, but this is advanced and usually not necessary just for copying.
  Example:

```bash
trap '' SIGINT
```

This disables Ctrl+C interrupt for that shell session.

To enable it back:

```bash
trap - SIGINT
```

(But again â€” this is overkill for simple copy-paste.)

---

ðŸ”µ **Summary:**
When pasting into a Linux terminal, **never press Ctrl+C while inside the terminal** â€” just **Ctrl+Shift+V** (or right-click paste).
The terminal thinks you're sending an interrupt when you press Ctrl+C.

Would you like me to show you a clean way to paste a full multi-line script without errors (like using `cat <<EOF` or `vim`)? It's very handy! ðŸš€
